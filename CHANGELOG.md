# Changelog

All notable changes to Talent Search. Newest first.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-11-09

### Search and candidates
- Search syntax: OR groups, exclusions and field prefixes, with a note on how your search was read. More filters, and saved searches you can color.
- Color tags on the Candidates table, each person's page, CSV exports and the AI app.
- A duplicate finder with bulk actions, better paste-a-profile parsing, and CSV export aliases.
- Imports never skip an email column, re-imports only move forward, and every email a person has counts. Tags like `c#` and `f#` stay whole.

### Interviews
- A month calendar, with the week view still available, and calendar (`.ics`) downloads.

### Your AI app
- Talent Search skills for Claude Code, Codex and Claude Desktop, installed from inside the app.
- Guards against instructions hidden in profiles and pages: warnings in the app, and the AI app can never delete anything.
- A Settings switch that tells the AI app to stay off sites whose terms forbid scraping, with a lower hourly cap.
- The AI app never adds an email to a person already saved, and says which ones it left out. It refuses more than 60 years of experience.

### Getting started
- A first-run guided tour with demo data that you can skip or replay.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-09

The first release. Talent Search is a candidate database that lives on your own computer, that opens in your web browser for you and tools for your AI app.

### Search and candidates
- Fast search across names, titles, companies, locations and "about" text, with highlights. Shorthand like `sf`, `nyc` and `swe` works.
- Candidate pages with a timeline of calls and notes, follow-up dates, duplicate merging and paste-a-profile.
- Filters on the Candidates table, and a work history that survives re-imports.

### Jobs and pipelines
- Jobs with your own stages (rename and add per job), a drag-and-drop board and a table grouped by stage.
- A shortlist where AI-found people wait for you to Keep or Pass, a hiring plan and a loop planner.
- Outreach with follow-up sequences, batch follow-ups and reply tracking.

### Today
- One page for what needs you: upcoming interviews and follow-ups, people stuck in a stage, jobs that need more candidates and profiles that may be out of date. Each kind can be turned off.

### Interviews and decisions
- Interviews shown in your own time zone, a week view, per-interviewer feedback and a chase list for feedback still owed.
- A Decide view that compares finalists, plus an offer and close workspace.

### Clients and reports
- Clients and hiring managers, update days, a Client desk and a Friday send-out.
- Client reports, submittals with a write-up of why each person fits, and an Ops review of the whole desk.

### Working with AI apps
- Connect Claude Desktop, Codex or LM Studio from the Connect AI page. In Claude, results show as cards and a pipeline board in the chat.
- The Claude Desktop connection now checks itself: it verifies what it wrote, tests that Talent Search starts and answers, explains how to fully quit and reopen Claude, and repairs itself if the app moved. A Test connection button and `talent check-claude` give a full report.
- A review queue with a Cautious mode, per-app trust levels and hourly caps for AI changes, with Undo for AI work. The AI can never delete anything.
- Ready-made AI recipes that copy a prompt and open Claude.

### Importing and exporting
- CSV import with column matching, CSV export, paste-a-resume and a weekly ATS re-import that keeps stage history.
- A database backup you can download while the app runs, and sample data to try things out (removed with one button).

### Look and feel
- Color themes, with "Sunset to forest" as the default.
- Gentler hover and focus states so clickable things light up, and more breathing room between elements.

### Safety and privacy
- Everything is stored in one file on your computer. The app listens only on 127.0.0.1, has no accounts and no telemetry, and the window is locked with a key.

### Install
- Mac disk image: open it and drag Talent Search onto Applications. A zip is still available.
- Windows zip and a new Linux build (`.tar.gz`).
- Every build is tested before release, including that AI apps can start Talent Search from it.
- Step-by-step install and troubleshooting guide in the README.
